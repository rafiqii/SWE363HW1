<!-- In my journey in this homework, i started off with little to no information 
        about web devolopment. So i decided to startoff visiting W3schools to start practicing 
        and cover any points i have missed. I started the first day of my homework just reading and
        practicing html in W3schools and after i finished i went over the slides again. This homework
        is a combination of information i put together from w3schools, slides and some friends that
        helped me debug some issues. -->
