    <cite>History of Mecca, Wikipedia:</cite> Bakkah, this is presumed to have been the name of
    the city at the time of Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition)
    and it is also transliterated as Baca, Baka, Bakah, Bakka, Becca, Bekka, among others.
    Makkah, Makkah al-Mukarramah and Mecca
    In South Arabic, the language in use in the southern portion of the Arabian
    Peninsula at the time of Muhammad.
    This is presumed to have been the origin of the current form of the name.
    "Makkah" is the official transliteration used by the Saudi government and is closer to
    the Arabic pronunciation.[21][22] The government adopted Makkah as the official spelling in
    the 1980s, but is not universally known or used worldwide.[21] The full official name is
    Makkah al-Mukarramah "Makkah" is used to refer to the city in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Fath
    (48), verse 24.
    The word "Mecca" in English has come to be used to refer to any place that draws large
    numbers of people, and because of this some English-speaking Muslims have come to regard
    the use of this spelling for the city as offensive. Mecca is the familiar form of the
    English transliteration for the Arabic name of the city,

    The consensus in academic scholarship is that "Macoraba", the place mentioned in Arabia
    Felix by Claudius Ptolemy, is Mecca. Many etymologies have been proposed but the most
    suitable one is that it is derived from the Old South Arabian root "M-K-R-B" which means
    temple.
